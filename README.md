# Day 01 – Introduction to Arduino & GPIO Programming
## Objective:
- To understand the pin configuration of Arduino Uno and perform basic digital output operations using GPIO pins.
## Concepts Covered:
- Overview of Arduino Uno
- Introduction to ATmega328P microcontroller architecture
- Digital Input/Output pins configuration
- Understanding built-in LED (connected to Digital Pin 13)
- Basics of Embedded C programming in Arduino IDE
- pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and delay() functions

## Practical Implementation:
- Configured digital pin as OUTPUT.
- Implemented blinking of:
- Built-in LED (Pin 13)
- External LED connected to a digital GPIO pin with current limiting resistor.
- Observed ON/OFF timing using delay function.

## Learning Outcome:
- Gained understanding of GPIO configuration.
- Learned how microcontroller pins control external hardware.
- Understood basic embedded programming structure (setup() and loop()).
- Successfully interfaced external LED with Arduino board.
